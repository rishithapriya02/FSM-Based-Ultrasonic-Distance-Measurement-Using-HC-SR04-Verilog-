# FSM-Based-Ultrasonic-Distance-Measurement-Using-HC-SR04-Verilog-
Designed a Verilog FSM to interface the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor in simulation. The module generates precise trigger pulses, measures echo pulse width to calculate distance in millimeters, detects obstacles within a defined range, and ensures correct timing between measurements. Verified using RTL simulation.
